# Menu Example

I implemented what I learned reading Java: The complete Reference Eleventh Edition, and followed along with various video tutorials to make a simple window. This project is meant for me to grasp terminology, and gain hands on experience using Eclipse. I wanted to learn, and observe, the JVM and JRE in action.

## Getting Started

No special knowledge is required, use and explore the window as you would any other window.

### Prerequisities

No prerequisities are needed.

## Built With

This game was built using Java, no other programs are needed to use this.
